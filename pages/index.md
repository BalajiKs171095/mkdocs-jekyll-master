## **Hot Instance**

Hot Instance are lab environments that are deployed and is ready to be assigned to registering users in an ODL. Hot instance is a great feature that lets you be ready with the required environments for a workshop.

For example, if you want to provision 60 environments for a workshop and you don't want any user's to get a randomly failed azure environment, you can enable self intelligence in CloudLabs and CloudLabs will take care that the failed hot instances are deleted automatically and new deployments are added till sufficient hot instances are ready.
